Simple wordpress plugin for embedding code in posts/pages for such things as iframes.
To use the plugin you create a custom field, add any HTML code, then update. 
Within the editor, you use the following: [field name="mycustomfield"]
For example, if the custom field is called "myiframe," the embedded 
code would be: [field name="myiframe"]
