Simple Wordpress plugin for embedding HTML code in posts/pages for such things as iframes.

then update. Within the editor window, use the following: [field name="mycustomfield"]
For example, if the custom field is called "myiframe," the embedded 
code would be: [field name="myiframe"]

**NOTE** You can embed the code while in Visual mode.
